Shell aliases to simplify CLI tasks

These are my personal aliases that I like to have on hand to help increase my productivity.
Storing them here so I can easily access them from whatever machine I am on.

If you find them useful too, download them and add them to your rc file. (~./bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
